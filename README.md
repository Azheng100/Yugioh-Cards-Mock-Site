## *Description*:
*This is simply a fan project and not an actual card selling website.*

Yugioh is a popular Japanese card game made for children and played by Adults that are willing to pay for overpriced cardboard pieces. Instead of helping my fellow duelists make better financial choices, I will instead build a website that will spiral us further down in debt. As we all know, the real way to become the next YCS champion is to spend money and luck sack. Or play mystic mine. 




### *How to get started*:
I will be using the YGOprodeck api as the card repository. The project will be built using the react js platform. I plan to make a mock shopping feature that will let players see how much money they would be spending on their total card purchase. I want to create a search directory that will allow players to navigate through and find the cards they want.
